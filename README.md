## I Build Systems — Not Just Applications

I engineer structured, scalable backend systems using Laravel and modern PHP standards.

My work is centered around:

- Enterprise-grade multi-role architectures
- Secure and scalable REST APIs
- Payment processing infrastructures
- Complex dynamic form engines
- RBAC implementation with Spatie
- Admin systems with strict permission control
- Service + Repository structured architecture

I care about structure, performance, and long-term maintainability.

## Architecture Philosophy

Controller  
→ Service Layer  
→ Repository Layer  
→ Database  

Strict validation using Form Requests  
Policy-driven authorization  
Encrypted route identifiers  
Queue workers for heavy processing  
Scheduled automation  
Webhook-based event systems  

No tightly coupled logic.  
No business logic inside controllers.  
No shortcuts.
